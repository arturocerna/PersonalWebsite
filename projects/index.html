                            This project uses the disjoint set data structure to construct a random maze that begins in the top left
                            and ends in the bottom right. User can input an integer and this program will generate a new window showing
                            the randomly generated maze. Below you can download the .jar file to run this program, and view the github repository as well.
                        </p>

                        <h4> How to Run .jar file </h4>
                        <p>
                            First, you need to make sure that you have a Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer.
                            If you do not, you can find the latest Java SE Runtime Environment
                            <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">here</a> <br>

                            Once you have the JRE installed, you can download the <a style="color: blue;"href="MazeGenerator.jar" download>.jar file</a> and run it in your terminal/command prompt.
                            Go to the directory within command prompt where you put the .jar file and enter the command <br> <br> Java -jar MazeGenerator.jar <br> <br>

                            You will be prompted on the command line to enter an integer. This integer determines the amount of cells the maze will have: the bigger the number,
                            the more complex the maze. When you do enter an integer, your randomly generated maze will appear on a new window!
                            You can enter another integer in order to generate a new maze, or type in any other type of input in order to close the program.
                        </p>
                        <hr class="my-4">
                        <h4> Bugs/ Features to be added later </h4>
                        <p>
                            The main problem with this program is the fact that I use a fixed canvas size. With higher numbers, the maze appears to be just a black screen, since 
                            the program ends up 'painting' the whole canvas black due to the maze being too dense.

                            Another feature I would like to add to the future is the ability to turn the maze to a jpeg or png and save it on your machine. That way we can print out mazes
                            for any young nephew or nieces that are easily impressed.

                            Reading in from a .csv file that contains actors and the movies starred in, this program creates a graph,
                            Implemented as a Hashmap, where actors and movies are the nodes/key and the value is the adjacency list. From 
                            this, this program can enter 2 modes.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                Mode 1
                            <br>
                            From this data structure, The program reads in a file that takes in actor pairs and 
                            determines 'distance' in the graph between the two actors. In other words, goes into all the actors the pair have worked with to
                            see if they have a costar in common. If they don't, the program looks into all the the costars they have had to see if there is a
                            common actor. This repeats until a common actor is found or there is no such actor. The program then outputs the path of actors
                            and movies that it took to get from one actor to another in a seperate file which must be given at runtime.
                            <br>
                                Mode 2
                            <br>
                            Using the same graph, The program creates a guest list for a party in which every actor invited knows a given minimum amount of 
                            people. To do this, we repeatedly delete every actor that does not know the minimum amount of people
                            from the graph until everyone in the graph fit the requirements. It then outputs the results in a different file, which is given at runtime

                        <p>
                            This is a project I had to complete for my data structures class and since it was due around finals, it felt like it was crunch time. 
                            Thats why the code itself is so sloppy. very few comments, extremely bad variable names, overall unreadable code. But because a major factor
                            of this assignment was time efficiency, I really had to understand how to get the most out of c++. There where small things I learned that I did not know
                            made a huge difference, such as string concatenation. I mistakenly did something like string = string + "string" instead of string += "string" and that
                            cost me an extremely significant amount of time since the former was constantly recreating a string, and when the string becomes big, a single call of that line
                            can take ages. There were alot of small realizations like that one on this project that made me happy that I went through that process. I thought about going through 
                            the code a cleaning it up, but I am hoping that in the future I can look back at this code and see a huge progression in my skills.
