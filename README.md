# PersonalWebsite
My personal website repository.

This repository is updated whenever I make a change to my website. 
As I am constantly updating it as I learn more HTML/CSS/javascript, there should be alot of commits.
I hope that there is significant progress from where I began and where I end.
The domain where this project is hosted is www.arturocerna.com, but I generally update that less as 
it is a bigger pain to update the domain than to just commit from the terminal.
